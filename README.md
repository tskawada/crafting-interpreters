# Crafting Interpreters

This repository contains my TypeScript implementation of the Lox language interpreter in the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).
- It supports up to Chapter 10 of the textbook.
- Several additional implementations, including other operators, have been added.
